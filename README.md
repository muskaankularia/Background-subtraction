Background subtraction for videos

It was implemented using mixture of Gaussian model given in ”Adaptive background mixture models for real-time tracking” proposed by Strauffer and Grimson. It is done by fitting k-gaussians on each pixel, which model the pixel value distribution using E.M. algorithm.
